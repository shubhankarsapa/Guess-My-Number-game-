# Guess My Number! - README
## Introduction
"Guess My Number!" is a fun, retro-inspired game built in JavaScript, reminiscent of the classic games from the 80s. The game challenges players to guess a secret number between 1 and 20, with feedback provided after each guess to guide them to the correct number.

## Gameplay
Players enter their guess into an input field and press "Check!" to submit their guess. The application will respond with hints such as "Too Low!", "Too High!", or "Correct Number!", depending on the player's input. The goal is to guess the number with the least number of attempts, and the game keeps track of the player's score, which starts at 20 and decrements by one with each incorrect guess.

## Features
Retro Design: A simple yet engaging interface that gives a nod to classic 80s gaming.
Score Tracking: Players start with a score of 20, which decreases by one with each incorrect guess.
Highscore System: The game records the high score, encouraging players to improve with each round.
Game Reset: A "Again!" button allows players to reset the game and try again, without resetting the high score.

## How to Play
Enter a number between 1 and 20 into the input field.
Click "Check!" to submit your guess.
Use the hints to adjust your next guess.
Aim for the highest score by finding the secret number with the fewest guesses.
